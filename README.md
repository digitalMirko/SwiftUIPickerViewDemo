In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a Swift UIPicker View with various results displayed on label rite above.

There are so many interesting things within swift. This demo shows one way to setup the UIPicker View on the bottom of 
the app and then on top in a label display the various picks below in a label on the top of the screen. As the user clicks
the icon they are taken right into the app and the UIPicker View is set by default on the color white.As the user flips 
through the assorted colors in the UIPicker they will be displayed in the label on top.
